[{"content":"I am currently a 4th-year undergraduate students working on independent research projects with the following labs:\nDr. Amy Wong\u0026rsquo;s Lab I am interested in comprehending the cellular developmental trajectories during human lung development at a single-cell resolution. This endeavour aims to elucidate the lineages of basal stem cells within a proximal iPSC model. Additionally, I employ gene-editing technologies to create a reporter cell line for distal lung development and maturation.\nDr. Paul Delgado-Olguin\u0026rsquo;s Lab I primarily investigate the dynamics of genome organization in cardiomyocytes using high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic approaches to understand the regulatory mechanisms of heart development and regeneration. I also develop and characterize a new model of pediatric heart failure.\nDr. Chung-Wai Chow\u0026rsquo;s Lab I study oscillometry as a new method to assess lung function in patients following lung transplantation as well as patients with other lung diseases, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and COVID-19. Using the Toronto Lung Transplant Program (TLTP) database, I am investigating the potential of oscillometry to predict outcomes in lung transplant patients.\n","permalink":"https://j-y26.github.io/j-yang/research/","summary":"I am currently a 4th-year undergraduate students working on independent research projects with the following labs:\nDr. Amy Wong\u0026rsquo;s Lab I am interested in comprehending the cellular developmental trajectories during human lung development at a single-cell resolution.
