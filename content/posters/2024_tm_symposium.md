### Abstract

**Introduction/Background:** The mammalian heart remains one of the least regenerative tissues. However, the mouse heart exhibits a remarkable regenerative capacity at postnatal day 0 (P0). Yet, such regenerative capacity is rapidly lost by P7. This transition aligns with cardiomyocyte maturation, characterized by hypertrophic growth, enhanced metabolic activity, and cell cycle exit. Dramatic transcriptional changes happen during cardiomyocyte maturation. However, regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we aim to elucidate the developmental changes of chromatin organization and associated histone modifications that regulate cardiomyocyte maturation.

**Methods:** We employed High-throughput Chromatin Conformation Capture (Hi-C) and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) to probe the chromatin landscape of regenerative cardiomyocytes of C57BL6/J mice. This analysis revealed genome-wide chromatin topology and distribution of histone marks associated with active (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) and inactive (H3K27me3) chromatin. In comparison to 14-week adult hearts (GSE96693), we revealed developmentally dynamic chromatin interactions associated with temporal gene expression changes in E18.5, P7, 8-week, and 16-week hearts revealed by RNAseq.

**Results:** Profiling of the chromatin topology revealed distinct compartment and sub-compartment configurations specific to regenerative cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte maturation is characterized by a global loss of inter-chromosomal and long-range intra-chromosomal interactions with a moderate degree (~9%) of compartment flips, associated with 308 developmentally differentially expressed genes. Among the altered compartments, we further observed a global reduction in topology-associated domains (TADs) characterized by boundary expansion, and as a result, increased short loop formation in adult cardiomyocytes. By intersecting gene expression, histone modification, and chromatin interactions, we identified key regulatory interactions that define epigenetic signatures of the regenerative heart.

**Discussion/Conclusion:** Collectively, our result suggests the key role of the three-dimensional chromatin architecture in regulating postnatal transition of cardiomyocyte maturation, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the loss of regenerative capacity in cardiac development.
