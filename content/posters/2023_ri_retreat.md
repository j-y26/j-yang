### Abstract

The mammalian heart remains one of the least regenerative tissues. However, the mouse heart exhibits a remarkable regenerative capacity at postnatal day 0 (P0), contrasting with the diminished regenerative potential observed at postnatal day 7 (P7). This transition aligns with the process of cardiomyocyte maturation, during which cardiomyocytes are characterized by hypertrophic growth, sarcomere organization, enhanced metabolic activity, and cell cycle exit. It has been shown that major features of mature, post-mitotic cardiomyocytes are established early during development, but despite efforts to define the gene expression signatures of these processes, the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate these maturational changes, including chromatin organization and histone modifications, remain elusive. In this study, we employed Hi-C and CUT&Tag to probe the chromatin landscape of regenerative cardiomyocytes, which respectively revealed genome-wide chromatin structure and distribution of active (H3K4me1) and inactive (H3K27me3) histone modifications. Our results showed distinct signatures of long-range regulatory contacts and histone marks associated with active and poised domains. Intersecting these chromatin signatures with cardiomyocyte-specific gene expression identified key regulatory interactions in the neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. In a developmental context, we observed a global loss of long-range chromatin interactions in non-regenerative cardiomyocytes, whereas the presence of nested domains, representing sets of adjacent and collectively regulated genes, are more prevalent in the P0 hearts. Collectively, our result suggests the key role of the three-dimensional chromatin architecture in regulating postnatal transition of cardiomyocyte maturation, providing insights into the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the loss of regenerative capacity in cardiac development.
